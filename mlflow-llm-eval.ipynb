        "With the emerging of ChatGPT, LLMs have shown its power of text generation in various fields, such as question answering, translating and text summarization. Evaluating LLMs’ performance is slightly different from traditional ML models, as very often there is no single ground truth to compare against. MLflow provides an API ```mlflow.evaluate()``` to help evaluate your LLMs.\n",

        "2. **Metrics**: the metrics to compute, LLM evaluate will use LLM metrics.\n",
        "\n",

The example builds a simple question-answering evaluation pipeline using Anthropic's Claude API. It interacts with the Claude API to get responses and then evaluates the responses based on a custom metric. The results, including the average matching accuracy, are logged to MLflow. You can paste it to your IPython or local editor and execute it, and install missing dependencies as prompted. Running the code requires an Anthropic API key, if you don’t have one, you can set it up by following the Anthropic guide."

For the list of built-in heuristic metrics and how to define a custom metric with your own function definition, see the Heuristic-based Metrics section.\n",

It overcomes the limitations of heuristic-based metrics, which often miss nuances like context and semantic accuracy. LLM-as-a-Judge metrics provides a more human-like evaluation for complex language tasks while being more scalable and cost-effective than human evaluation. MLflow provides various built-in LLM-as-a-Judge metrics and supports creating custom metrics with your own prompt, grading criteria, and reference examples.
